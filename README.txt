Wulfy there is a cute little rascal that will sit on your desktop and connect to your spotify web player!

FAQ
Q: What exactly am I allowing you access for? 
So the spotify API has these "scopes" that you can ask for permission for.
Now I just ask for what's currently playing, but that's divided up into three different requests:
user-read-playback-state -> This let's Wulf know that he can dance to your music
user-modify-playback-state -> This Wulf pause/start your songs and go to the next track
user-read-currently-playing -> This lets Wulf know when exactly you stop or start your songs outside of him

Wulf does not track or read any personal information, because it simply does not matter to him. He loves you, regardless
of what you listen to or who you are <3 

You can read more about these permissions in the link below if you want to know more info.

Q: Can I change the Settings.txt file?
Yes you can, however I did not create a robust file reader, so you can only change the animal name.
So you should see something like 1 line that says "CurrentAnimal=Wulf". Now you can change Wulf to something another one of the animals
but I recommend that you do it via the actualy exectuable rather than manually. 

Q: Who made these amazing animations???
Great question! The lovely Lauren Jackson of Moonbay created Wulf and his friends
She is the creator and owner of Wulf, and has graciously let me use her animations to develop little Wulfy.
Check her stuff out! Moonbay has a variety of other creations and art that you may find interesting!

Q: Are there going to be any updates to Wulf?
Currently there is nothing planned for the future, however that may change.
Likely it will be bug fixes if there is anything major that is happening, or if Spotify changes their API.

Q: Who are you?
I'm Eric Bejleri! I mostly make games, but I decided to create this app cause I wanted to have a little pet on my desktop.
You can follow my itch.io if you want to see any other things I may make in the future, or if you're looking to hire me ;)

Q: How can I contact you about bugs or issues?
You can email me here: solariumgamestudios@gmail.com
Just know that I may or may not respond. But I will be checking occasionally.
